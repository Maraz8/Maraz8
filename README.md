👋 Hi, I’m Alessandro Marazzi - @Maraz8 (he/him)  
I'm currently a founder member and head of Quant Research in Bocconi Students Quantitative Finance Society.  
I'll use this account to showcase my main projects.  
You can find projects about:
- Stochastic processes (such as GBM, fBM, BS model)
- Volatility modeling (such as SABR, Heston Model, Bergomi Model)
- Portfolio optimization (such as MC simulation & Markowitz model)
To ensure understandability every project is paired with a "README" md file in order to let you know what it does

You are welcome!
